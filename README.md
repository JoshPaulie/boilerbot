# boilerbot ♨️
Simple template (boilerplate) bot for discord.py

## Download & Usage
**Varies between OS**
1) Clone repo to directory (Replace **\<your bot name>** whatever you'd like your directory to be named. Otherwise it will be named boilerbot)

    `git clone https://github.com/JoshPaulie/boilerbot.git <your bot name>`

2) Rename your .env file and set your [discord token](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) variable

3) Run the bot.py to start bot

## Virtual Environment (venv)
Using a [venv](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/) is **highly recommended**

Once created and activated, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the directory

## How to set .env variables
1) Rename the file `.env.example` to anything ending in `.env`
2) Replace NULL with your discord token
